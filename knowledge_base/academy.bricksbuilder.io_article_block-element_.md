## Block Element

The Block element is one of the fourlayout elementsin Bricks (1.5+).

Introduced together with theSection&Divelement it allows you to create flexible layouts in record time.

It offers the same controls as theContainerelement (flexbox, query loop, etc.). But uses a default width of 100%.

This makes it the perfect element to use inside of a Container (e.g. column/row based layout). Or wherever you need to span the entire available width, plus quick access to direction & alignment settings. As the Block element usesflexby default.

If want your layout element to only take up the space of its content, use theDivelement instead.
