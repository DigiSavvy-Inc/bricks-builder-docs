## Components

Components, available as anexperimentalfeature since Bricks 1.12, let you create reusable elements.

`experimental`

The content of each instance (text, icons, images, etc.) is further customizable through properties. üòç

While templates serve as the blueprint for specific pages, components are the blueprints for a specific element (i.e. button) or collection of elements (i.e. a card) that you want to reuse and even customize throughout your website.

Create a component from an element (including all its children) such as a button, card, navigation, or even an entire hero section, and reuse it anywhere else on your site.

Any change to the main component automatically applies to every instance of this component.

This keeps the structure and style of those reusable elements consistent throughout your website.

Resulting in an extremely consistent, scalable, and easy to maintain workflow. üöÄ

### How to create a component

Create a component from any element, except Template & Filter elements, by right-clicking on the element, and select theSave as componentaction.

`Save as component`

In the popup that appears, enter a name (required), category (optional), and description (optional) for your new component. Once done, clickCreateto finish creating your component.

`Create`

Once created, you can insert this new component anywhere on your site like any other element.

### Components Library

You can access all your components from theComponentstab, located next to theElementspanel tab.

`Components`

`Elements`

From here you can add a component to the canvas or structure panel via drag & drop or click (same as any other element).

You can perform the following actions by clicking the respective icons at the top of theComponentstab:

`Components`

- Import:Import a components JSON file from another installation.
- Export:Export all components of your site as a JSON file. To export a specific component, hover over it, and click the ‚Äúexport‚Äù action icon.
- Delete:Click the ‚Äúdelete‚Äù icon to enter the delete mode. Once activated, hover over the component you want to delete, and click the ‚Äúdelete‚Äù icon. We recommend to first export all components before performing any deletion.

#### Instance count & location (current page/global)

Below the name of the component is the instance count. For our ‚ÄúCard‚Äù component it says ‚ÄúInstances: 3/6‚Äù. The first number (3) is the instance count of the page you are currently editing, and the second number (6) is the total instance count global/site-wide.

Hover over the component, and clicking the ‚Äúglobe‚Äù icon shows you all instances of this component on the ‚ÄúCurrent page‚Äù, and a list with count of all the ‚ÄúOther Pages‚Äù on which this component is being used.

### Instances ‚Äì How to reuse a component

Every time you add a component to a page, a so-calledInstanceof that component is created.

`Instance`

Changes to the main component automatically reflect in all instances of this component throughout your entire website.

The following screenshot shows three instances of our Card component:

Before we explore customizing our instances, let‚Äôs have a look at ‚Ä¶

### Editing the main component

To view and edit the elements of the main component, which is the source of truth for all its instances, right-click on any instance (purple) and selectEdit component.

`Edit component`

Alternatively, you can also click the gear icon in the control panel header of the instance to enter the component editing mode:

You are now editing the main component.Indicated by the purple color in the control panel header.

As mentioned before, any change you perform on the main component applies to all instances of this component on your site.

The main component header contains the following actions:

- Description(info icon): Click to show/hide the component description (editable).
- Category(folder icon): Click to show/hide the component category (editable).
- Properties(box icon): Click to view the component properties panel.
- Instance(arrow icon): Exit the component edit mode, and go back to the instance you were editing before or the components panel. Pressing the ESCAPE key also exists the main component.

Now that you are editing the main component you can see and edit all elements of this component in the structure panel:

To edit the title of our Card component, select the Heading element inside our component, and change its text to ‚ÄúJust a card‚Äù.

All instances of our Card component automatically reflect this change:

While this is great for using the exact same element multiple times throughout your site, and updating the main component automatically applies every change to all instances, the real power of components lies in their ability to customize the content of each instance throughProperties.

`Properties`

### Properties

Properties allow you to expose content settings for each instance.

Lets create some properties so each Card instance on our website can have its own unique card title and image.

There‚Äôs a simple, two-step process of (1) creating and (2) connecting properties.

NOTE:Creating and managing properties requires full builder access.

#### 1) Creating a property

To access the properties panel, select any instance of the component you want to edit.

Then click the ‚Äúedit‚Äù icon in the properties control panel on the left-hand side:

If there aren‚Äôt any instances of the component you want to edit on the current page, you can go to the Components library, hover over the respective component, and click the ‚Äúedit‚Äù icon.

If you are editing the main component, you can access the Properties panel by clicking the ‚Äúbox‚Äù icon in the panel header (highlighted in the screenshot below).

#### Property types

First, select the type of property you want to create:

- Text:For any text or textarea setting such as the Heading or the Basic text.
- Rich Text: For any rich text setting such as the Rich text or Accordion content.
- Icon:For any icon setting such as the Icon or Icon Box
- Image:For any image setting such as the Image or Logo
- Image gallery:For any image gallery setting such as the Image gallery or Carousel element.
- Link:For any link setting such as the Button or Heading link.
- Query loop:For any query loop setting as available on all layout elements.

We want to expose the heading of our card component, so we select the property typeText.

`Text`

Theproperty nameis mandatory. Choose a descriptive name. This is especially important for complex components with potentially dozens of different properties, so everyone working with this component knows exactly what each property is for.

Providing a shortproperty descriptionis optional, but can be helpful for anyone working with component.

Selecting aproperty groupis optional, but very useful for complex components with multiple properties and potentially even the same name.

Thedefault valueis optional. It‚Äôll be used for the setting you connect this property to.

#### 2) Connecting a property to a setting

Now that you created our first property, we need to connect it to our desired element setting.

Also, the properties panel shows a message if any unconnected properties are detected.

Unconnected properties also have a ‚Äúbroken link‚Äù icon next to their name.

Lets connect our ‚ÄúCard heading‚Äù text property to the ‚ÄúHeading‚Äù element of our card component.

First, we select the ‚ÄúHeading‚Äù element inside our component.

You‚Äôll notice a round purple+icon next to the text control of our Heading element.

`+`

This+icon indicates that this element control can be connected to a property.

`+`

Clicking on this+icon reveals a list of properties that we can connect to this setting:

`+`

QUICK TIP:You can also create a new property by clicking the+icon, located at the top right, of the ‚ÄúConnect property‚Äù dropdown.

`+`

We can see the ‚ÄúCard heading‚Äù property that we just created in the dropdown and select it.

Once selected, our Heading text control shows the name of the property that we just connected:

Our default property value ‚ÄúDefault Card heading‚Äù that we set when we created this property in the previous step is now used as the text value for our all our Card headings.

And that‚Äôs it. You successfully created and connected your first property. ü•≥

You can continue creating and connecting as many properties as needed.

We used the same two-step process of creating & connecting for our image property so we can customize the ‚ÄúCard image‚Äù as well. Our component now looks like this:

#### Disconnecting a property

To disconnect a property from a settings, click the connected property setting, hover over the connected property name, and click the ‚Äúunlink‚Äù icon.

### Customizing an instance

Right now, all our Card components use the exact same content.

But we‚Äôve created two properties so we can customize the title & image of each Card instance. So lets do that by selecting the Card instance that you want to customize, then set custom property values in the control panel like this:

We could continue to also expose the button text through a text property, but you get the picture.

### Components as loops and inside loops

Components are also compatible with query loop. Either by enabling the loop on the component root or by having a loop inside the component.

In the following screenshot we use our Card component inside a loop. The Card title uses thepost_titledynamic data tag and the Card image uses thefeatured_imagetag to render the post title & featured image of the loop results.

`post_title`

`featured_image`

There‚Äôs also a property type ‚ÄúQuery loop‚Äù which allows you to customise your in-component query loop for every instance.

### Unlinking a component

To unlink an instance from a component, right-click on the instance, and select the ‚ÄúUnlink component‚Äù icon under the ‚ÄúEdit component‚Äù menu item.

Once unlinked, this instance is no longer tied to your main component, and can be edited independently, like any other normal element.

### PLANNED: Global element to component converter

We plan on providing a ‚ÄúGlobal element to Component‚Äù converter, that lets you convert all your global elements to components with one click. Once implemented we‚Äôll deprecate global elements in Bricks, which are redundant now that we‚Äôve got components, plus they never really took off in Bricks and are much better implementable through components anyway.

### Notes & Tips

- A component must have exactly one root element
- Components within components are not supported
- Components can‚Äôt be created from Template and Query Filter elements
- Components are easy to spot in the builder by their purple color
- You can change the label of each instance like any other element
- Take advantage of property groups when working with complex property setups
