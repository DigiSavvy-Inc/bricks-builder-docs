## Builder Access & Capabilities

Starting at version 2.0, Bricks gives you full control over who can access the builder, and what actions they’re allowed to perform. You can either assign apredefined capability, or create your owncustom capabilitythat allows only the specific permissions you enable for it.

This gives you complete freedom and control to tailor the builder experience to any roles (i.e. content editor, designer, client, etc.) depending on what they should be able to do.

### Access levels

There are two ways to manage builder access:

1. Use one of the predefined capabilities:Full access,Edit content, orNo access
2. Create your own custom builder capability with detailed permission control

#### Predefined capabilities

- Full access: Grants access to all features and permissions in the Bricks builder.
- Edit content: Limits the user to content editing only. Layout, styling, and structural controls are disabled. More specifically, this includes the following permissions:Access revisionsSet component properties (instance)Access content (HTML) settingsEdit all elementsEdit all Bricks-enabled post types
- Access revisions
- Set component properties (instance)
- Access content (HTML) settings
- Edit all elements
- Edit all Bricks-enabled post types
- No access: Blocks access to the Bricks builder entirely.

- Set component properties (instance)
- Access content (HTML) settings
- Edit all elements

### Creating a custom capability

If you need precise control over the actions a user or role should be able to perform, you can create your very own custom builder capability, following the steps outlines below.

1. Go toBricks > Settings > Builder access
2. UnderBuilder capabilities, clickAdd new capability

Inside the capability popup, you can:

- Give the capability a name & a description
- Enable exactly the permissions you want to grant

Once created, you can assign this capability to specific users or user roles.

### Assigning capabilities

You can assign any builder capability, whether predefined or custom:

- To auser role, underBricks > Settings > Builder access > Builder access

- To aspecific user, by editing their WordPress user profile

This gives you flexibility to apply permissions globally or individually.
