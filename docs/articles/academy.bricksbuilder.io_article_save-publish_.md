## Save & Publish

Bricks, by default, automatically saves your builder changes every 60 seconds.

To adjust or disable the autosave interval go toBricks > Settings > Builderin your WordPress admin area.

Bricks detects unsaved changes and will show you a prompt to help prevent data loss in case you reload the builder by accident.

To manually save your changes click theSave(disk) icon at the very right of the builder toolbar. Or use thekeyboard shortcutCMD/CTRL + S.

Bricks creates a revision/snapshotevery time builder data is saved using the standard WordPress Revisions API (learn more about revisions).

Designing a stunning website or writing compelling content is hard. Thatâ€™s why Bricks celebrates every saved change by displaying a random save message to keep your spirit up ðŸ™‚

You can, of course, customize those save messages via thebricks/builder/save_messagesfilter.

### Publishing A Page

When an unpublished page (draft) is saved the status does not change by itself. So once your page is ready to be published click thePublish(power) icon in the builder toolbar.
