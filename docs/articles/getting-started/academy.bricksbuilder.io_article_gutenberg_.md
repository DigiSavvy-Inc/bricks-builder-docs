## Gutenberg

If you’ve created your pages with Gutenberg you can continue editing them with Bricks without having to start all over again. Bricks will convert your Gutenberg blocks into Bricks elements.

You can also save and convert your Bricks generated data to Gutenberg data to continue editing a page with Gutenberg.

This way you’ll not suffer any lock-in effect when start using Bricks or if you should ever decide to move away from Bricks.

The block conversion works only with standard WordPress Gutenberg blocks, NOT custom-third party blocks

### How to load Gutenberg data into Bricks

Bricks allows you to convert your existing Gutenberg data into Bricks data. So you can continue editing any page created with Gutenberg in Bricks.

This only works for pages without any existing Bricks data. To delete the Bricks data of any page click the “Delete Bricks data” button in the WordPress top menu when editing a page in WordPress.

To enable this functionality go toBricks > Settingsand make sureLoad Gutenberg Data Into Bricksis selected.

### How to save Bricks data for Gutenberg

By default, your WordPress-generated data won’t change when editing with Bricks. If you want to save your Bricks generated data as Gutenberg data as well go toBricks > Settingsand selectSave Bricks Data As Gutenberg Data.
