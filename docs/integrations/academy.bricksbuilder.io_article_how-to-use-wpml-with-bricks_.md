### Translating website content

Translate your website content using WPML and Bricks through the following steps:

#### Bulk translation via translation management

WPML can translate any content you build with Bricks, including pages, posts, and templates.

To translate any Bricks content, start by going toWPML→Translation Management. From here, expand the section with the content you want to translate and select your items.

Next, choose which languages to translate into, your translation method, and whether you’d like to review translations before publishing them.

To review translations, simply go toWPML→Translationsand open your recent translation job. In most cases, your translations will be good to go, but you can always make changes using WPML’sAdvanced Translation Editor.

Once you’re done reviewing, you can instantly publish your translations and display them on your website. Remember that you need to switch languages to view your translations.

#### Translating individual pages and posts

WhileTranslation Managementis perfect for translating multiple pages and templates in one go, you may sometimes want to focus on a single page or post—either for fine-tuning the translation or making additional adjustments. In those cases, you can use theWPML Advanced Translation Editordirectly from the page/post edit screen.For comprehensive guidance on the various methods to translate pages and posts created by page builders like Bricks, refer toWPML’s official documentationabout this topic.

#### Template translation:

Translating templates follows the same process as translating WordPress pages & posts. Your template settings & type will be automatically duplicated to the translated post.

If the translation of templates is not automatically enabled when you activate WPML, pleaserefer to the WPML documentationon how to enable translation for custom post types, and ensure that it is enabled for “bricks_template”.

#### Example: Translating an archive template:

We have set up a simple archive template, which is applied to both the “Blog” page and its translated version, “Blogue”.

Each blog page will only display blog posts of that particular language (using only one template):

### Language switcher & menu translation

#### Language switcher

Bricks provides a “Language switcher” element for WPML, which you can add anywhere on your site.

By default, the language switcher comes with a basic preset design. However, you can always customize the switcher to match your website style:

1. Go toWPML→Languages.
2. Scroll down toCustom language switchersand check theEnablebox. This will reveal aCustomizebutton.
3. Click the button to set your custom preferences and save.

Your changes will immediately take effect on your website.

#### WPML menu translation:

Consult WPML documentation for guidance ontranslating WordPress menus.

### Sync Bricks data across translated pages

After translating a page, you might want to modify the original page. Those changes you perform with Bricks in your original page are not applied to the secondary language pages.

But Bricks and WPML make it seamless to sync your design changes across translated pages without affecting the translated text. Here’s how you can do it:

#### Step 1: Edit your original page with Bricks

Open the page in the primary language in the builder. Make the necessary design changes (edit layout, change styles, etc.)

#### Step 2: Save your changes

Once done, save your changes.

#### Step 3: Edit with WordPress

Close the builder by clicking “Edit with WordPress” to edit the page in WordPress.

#### Step 4: Update translation in the “Languages” panel

In the WordPress editor, navigate to the “Languages” panel. Typically found in the right sidebar or the document settings panel.

Here, you will find an option to edit or update the translation. Click the icon to open the “Advanced Translations Editor” as shown in this screenshot:

Translate any untranslated strings inside the Advanced Translation Editor, then click the “Complete” button at the bottom of the screen. Your new design changes are now synced with this translated page without affecting the translated text.

### Creating different designs per language

You can also access and edit the translated content directly with Bricks for specific language design or content modifications. For instance, instead of simply translating the text of your homepage, you can create a completely different layout that appeals to a specific target audience.

To create a different design per language:

1. Use the admin language switcher to change to the language you want to edit.
2. Find the page or template you want to make changes to and open it in Bricks.

1. Make your design changes and save. Your pages will now have different designs when switching languages.
